= Entity Module

:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

The Entity Module is responsible to abstract away the underlying SQL technology. There are two major database abstraction
paths tools like ours usually take from an architecture point of view:

* Active Record
* ORM

JUDO could be considered as an ORM.

== Context
In this documentation we will take the same example model as what we have in the xref:meta-jsl:01_intro.adoc[Introduction,window=_blank]
section of the JSL documentation.

If you are not familiar with it yet, make sure you check it out!

From a technical point of view, we will be using the xref:getting-started/04_bootstrap-spring-boot-project.adoc[Spring Boot starter,window=_blank]
as a reference stack in the sections below.

[NOTE]
====
Although we will be building on top of our Spring Boot starter, 99% of the terminologies used in this guide are the same
for the plain Java stack as well. The only differentiator should be the means of Dependency Injection.
====

== Security

The abstractions in JUDO take care of essential security concepts, such as utilizing prepared statements for database queries,
but the Entity Layer itself does not provide any high-level security abstractions, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC,window=_blank]
or similar.

Such concepts will be either brought in by higher-level Modules later, or developers could add them to their stacks right
now according to their business needs.

== Entities

Entities act as the data holders of the architecture. They are usually modeled in a way which represents the domain.
Developers can model business rules and consistency rules on entities besides data structure.

Every entity is represented as a table in the database.

Entity relations are represented as foreign-keys.

When generating the SDK for the Entity Module, the generator generates DAOs (Data Access Object), and Builders for every
Entity and parameters. This should allow developers to use type-safe intuitive APIs instead of e.g.: error-prone strings, etc...

== DAOs

Data Access Objects (a.k.a. DAOs) are responsible to manage the Entities. These elements of the SDK are used as entry points
which we can use to fetch, create, or mutate entities.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to note that in JUDO, developers cannot persist mutations on Entities directly. Changes made to entities
must be persisted with the use of DAOs.
====

== Entity Lifecycle

Given the following entity:

[source,jsl]
----
entity Address {
    field required String street;
    field required String city;
    field String country;
}
----

After code generation, we will get the following DAO APIs:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testCRUD() {
    Address address = addressDao.create(/* ... */);
    address = addressDao.update(/* ... */);
    addressDao.delete(address);
    addressDao.getById(/* ... */);
    addressDao.findAllById(/* ... */);
    addressDao.existsById(/* ... */);
    addressDao.query(/* ... */);
    addressDao.getAll();
    addressDao.countAll();
}

----

=== Entity Creation

By writing the following Java code:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testCreate() {
    Address address = addressDao.create(AddressForCreate.builder()
        .withCity("Budapest")
        .withCountry("Hungary")
        .withStreet("Rose")
        .build()
    );
}
----

**We should observe:**

* that we can utilize Builders (`AddressForCreate.builder()`) to easily create raw instances of Entities for create
* we are using the `.create()` method of the DAO
* the `create()` method returns an `Address` instance of our entity if the operation is successful.

All DAOs expect a <EntityName>ForCreate instance for creation and return a created <EntityName> instance. The concept behind this is that you can separate the created and not created instances. More details in the xref:java-sdk/01_entity_module.adoc#relations[relations] section

==== The builder is reusable

You can use a single builder more than once if needed

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testReuseBuilder() {
    AddressForCreateBuilder budapestAddressBuilder = AddressForCreate.builder()
            .withCity("Budapest")
            .withCountry("Hungary");

    Address address1 = addressDao.create(budapestAddressBuilder.withStreet("Rose").build());
    Address address2 = addressDao.create(budapestAddressBuilder.withStreet("Saint Stephen").build());
}
----

=== Default values

Entity fields and identifiers may have default values defined for them which can reduce the need of manual coding when
applicable.

[IMPORTANT]
Default values are assigned by the framework to primitive fields on Entity creation only!

**Example:**

[source,jsl]
----
enum OrderStatus {
    OPEN = 1;
    PAID = 2;
    DELIVERED = 3;
}

entity Order {
    field required OrderStatus status default: OrderStatus#OPEN;
    field Integer price default: 1500;
}
----

Using the example above, the following should be expected:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
OrderDao orderDao;

@Test
void testDefaults() {
    Order myOrder = orderDao.create(OrderForCreate.builder().build());

    assertEquals(OrderStatus.OPEN, myOrder.getStatus());
    assertEquals(Optional.of(1500), myOrder.getPrice());
}
----

=== Entity Retrieval / Fetching

Through direct DAO operations, entities can be fetched in multiple ways.

* By one's own ID
* By fetching all
* By forming a custom `query`

**Fetching by id:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testFetch() {
        Optional<Address> addressAgain = addressDao.getById(address1.identifier());
        List<Address> findedAddresesById = addressDao.findAllById(List.of((UUID) address1.identifier().getIdentifier(), (UUID) address2.identifier().getIdentifier()));
        boolean address1IsExist = addressDao.existsById((UUID) address1.identifier().getIdentifier());
}
----

The `.getById()` method in most cases should be used when we would like to fetch an updated version of an entity for which
we already have a reference to. The return type is Optional because the entity may not exist in the database.

The `.findAllById()` method is useful when you want to retrieve instances for a list of IDs. It's important to note that only the existing list elements are returned.

Use `.existsById()` if you need to check whether an element exists. This is faster than retrieving an instance.

**Fetching every Address entity in the database:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testAll() {
    List<Address> addressList = addressDao.getAll();
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
The `.getAll()` method should be used carefully, because for large data-sets, it could have a quite significant impact
on performance.

**Fetching with a custom query:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testQuery() {
    List<Address> addressesInBudapest = addressDao.query()
        .filterByCity(StringFilter.equalTo("Budapest"))
        .orderBy(AddressAttribute.CITY) // or
        //.orderByDescending(AddressAttribute.CITY)
        .selectList(20);

    Optional<Address> oneBudapsetAddress = addressDao.query()
        .filterByCity(StringFilter.equalTo("Budapest"))
        .orderBy(AddressAttribute.CITY) // or
        //.orderByDescending(AddressAttribute.CITY)
        .selectOne();
}
----

Every DAO has a `.query()` method which is a QueryCustomizer. It is a builder, and you can customize which entities you want to query.

This builder will have `.filter()` methods on it based on the corresponding fields of each Entity. You can filter primitive fields and primitive calculated members as well.

Sorting can be achieved by adding the `.orderBy()` or `.orderByDescending()` method calls to the builder, and providing
the field which we would like to use.

[INFO]
====
Multiple fields may be used for sorting and filtering as well.
====

As a last step, every query must be fired by calling the `.selectList()` or `.selectOne()`  method.

The `selectList` method can be used in various ways :

 * Without parameter `.selectList()`, you will gain all element that satisfy the query condition.
 * With one parameter `.selectList(Integer limit)`, you can define how many elements you'd like to fetch.
 * With two parameter `.selectList(Integer limit, Integer offset)`, you can define an offset to specify how many elements you'd like to skip.

__The return type is always a List.__

The `selectOne` method has two types :

 * Without a parameter `.selectOne()` you will retrieve the first element that satisfies the query condition.
 * With one parameter `.selectOne(Integer offset)` you will retrieve the first element after the skipped elements.

__The return type is always an Optional.__

If you don't need the instances of the entity, only the count of the fitting entities, you can use the `count` methods.

**Counting every Address entity in the database:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testAll() {
    Long numberOfAddress = addressDao.countAll();
}
----

**Counting with a custom query:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testCount() {
    Long numberOfAddressInBudapest = addressDao.query()
            .filterByCity(StringFilter.equalTo("Budapest"))
            .orderBy(AddressAttribute.CITY) // or
            //.orderByDescending(AddressAttribute.CITY)
            .count();
}
----

=== Entity Updates

As mentioned in the previous sections, it is not enough to update a field of an entity, that action alone does not take
care of the persistence part of the operation. In order to persist our changes, we need to do the following:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testUpdate() {
    Address address = addressDao.create(AddressForCreate.builder()
        // ...
        .build()
    );

    address.setCity("Oslo");
    // in the database the city still "Budapest"

    address = addressDao.update(address);
    // in the database now also "Oslo"

}
----

[IMPORTANT]
It is super important to notice that the `.update()` method has a return value! The Address instance passed as an argument
to the method will NOT be updated. Instead, the return value will have the updated values!

=== Entity validation

From this point onwards, we know how to create and update Entity instances, therefore it is time for us to talk about
validation rules.

Currently, we support two types of validation concepts:

* `required` modifiers
* type-based validations

To understand how to use the `required` modifier, please check the xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#primitive-field[Primitive Fields,window=_blank]
section of our documentation

**Example:**

[source,jsl]
----
type numeric PostalCode precision : 5 scale : 0;
type string String min-size : 0  max-size : 250;

entity Address {
    field required String street;
    field required String city;
    field PostalCode postalCode;
}
----

Based on the model above, the following should be observed:

* We defined a custom numeric type `PostalCode` with a `precision` of `5` and `scale` of `0`
* We defined a custom string type `String` with a `max-size` of `250`
* We defined fields `street` and `city` as `requried`
* We defined a field `postalCode` with our custom type `PostalCode`

As a result, the following will hold true:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testValidation() {
    // Will throw ValidationException because street and city is missing
    Address address1 = addressDao.create(AddressForCreate.builder()
        .withPostalCode(1490)
        .build()
    );

    // Will throw ValidationException because the postalCode attribute fails the precision rule defined on PostalCode
    Address address2 = addressDao.create(AddressForCreate.builder()
        .withCity("Budapest")
        .withStreet("Custom Street 2.")
        .withPostalCode(467890)
        .build()
    );
}
----

=== Entity Deletion

Deleting an entity can be done by calling the `.delete(/* ... */)` method on the DAO and providing a reference to an
entity we wish to delete.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Test
void testDelete() {
    addressDao.delete(address);
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note that deleting an entity could leave existing references in the codebase. These references must be handled
by developers to prevent them from being used in parts of the code where it could cause issues.
====

== Entity Inheritance

In JUDO Entities may inherit or "subclass" any number of Entities. Consistency is ensured by the toolbox in a way where
if there are colliding members, the transformation will throw an error.

This concept is explained in great detail in the xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#inheritance[Inheritance,window=_blank]
section of the JSL DSL docs.

Given the following example:

[source,jsl]
----
entity User {
    identifier required Email email;
}

entity abstract Customer {
    field required Address address;
    relation Order[] orders opposite: customer;
}

entity Person extends Customer, User {
    field required String firstName;
    field required String lastName;
    field String fullName <= self.firstName + " " + self.lastName;
}
----

The corresponding `PersonDao` and `Person` Java class will inherit the members from both the `Customer` and `User` entities.

**For example:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Test
void testInheritance() {
    Person johnPerson = personDao.create(PersonForCreate.builder()
            .withFirstName("John")
            .withLastName("Doe")
            .withEmail("john@doe.com")
            .withAddress(AddressForCreate.builder()
                    .withStreet("Rose")
                    .withCity("Budapest")
                    .build()
            ).build()
    );

    List<Order> ordersForJohn = personDao.queryOrders(johnPerson).selectList();

    String city = johnPerson.getAddress().getCity();
}
----

[NOTE]
In this example you may notice that the list of Orders is queried through the `personDao`. The logic behind this will be
explained in great detail in the next sections.

=== AdaptTo
You can get the ancestors of the Person entity if you need it. Use the `adaptTo(Class<T> target)` method.

This method casts the actual element to the target class.

For example :

Each DAO has its own Identifier class, so if you want to use the CustomerDAO to retrieve a Person as a Customer, you'll need to adapt it.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Autowired
UserDao userDao;

@Autowired
CustomerDao customerDao;

@Test
void testAdaptTo() {

    Optional<Customer> johnDoAsACustomer = customerDao.getById(johnPerson.adaptTo(Customer.class).identifier());
    assertTrue(johnDoAsACustomer.isPresent());

    Optional<User> johnDoAsAUser = userDao.getById(johnPerson.adaptTo(User.class).identifier());
    assertTrue(johnDoAsAUser.isPresent());

    // Always will be empty
    Optional<Address> johnDoAsAAddres = addressDao.getById(johnPerson.adaptTo(Address.class).identifier());
    assertEquals(Optional.empty(), johnDoAsAAddres);

}
----

[IMPORTANT]
Only use this method if there is a relation between the entities. This cast is a map between entities. It is up to you to decide how to use it correctly.

== Abstract Entity

The `abstract` modifier has the following effect on entities and DAOs:

* Entities are **not** instantiable via Java code
* Corresponding DAOs do not have a `.create(/* ... */)` method on them

__ You can notice the generated DAO for the Customer entity does not contain the create method. __

== Entity Members

The following members can be declared for each Entity:

* fields
* identifiers
* relations
* calculated members
* queries

=== Fields

There are two types of `fields`:

* Primitive
* Composite

Before continuing, make sure you double-check the corresponding xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#composition[Composition,window=_blank]
section in the JSL DSL docs understand the reason behind this split.

In essence primitive fields can be for example: derived types of strings, numbers, etc... while "composite fields" can
be other entities or collections of entities.

[IMPORTANT]
The lifecycle of Entity fields are tied to their inclusive Entity, similarly how Aggregate Roots work in DDD.

In the example below, we are showcasing both types under the same Entity:

[source,jsl]
----
entity Order {
    field required OrderStatus status = OrderStatus#OPEN;
    field OrderItem[] orderItems;
    // ...
}
----

Managing the fields `status` and `orderItems` is done directly on the `Order` instance:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
CustomerDao customerDao;

@Autowired
ProductDao productDao;

 @Autowired
OrderDao orderDao;

@Test
void testFields() {
    Optional<Customer> johnCustomer = customerDao.getById(johnPerson.adaptTo(Customer.class).identifier());

    Product butter = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Master Butter").withPrice(2).build());

    //Create reusable builder for OrderItem
    OrderItemForCreateBuilder orderItemForCreateBuilder = OrderItemForCreate.builder().withAmount(50).withProduct(butter);

    //Create reusable builder for Order
    OrderForCreateBuilder orderForCreateBuilder = OrderForCreate.builder()
            .withStatus(OrderStatus.OPEN)
            .withCustomer(johnCustomer.get());

    // addTo an OrderItemForCreate to the OrderForCreate
    Order order = orderDao.create(orderForCreateBuilder.addToOrderItems(orderItemForCreateBuilder.build()).build());

    order.getOrderItems().get(0).setAmount(300);

    Order updatedOrder = orderDao.update(order);

    assertTrue(300 == updatedOrder.getOrderItems().get(0).getAmount());
}
----

In the example above we are creating an `Order`, and after it's creation we are adding an item to it, and lastly persist
the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When we create or fetch Orders, the `Order` instance will "pull in" all of it's fields, which means that if there is an
entity with a field, or fields which may contain multiple hundreds or thousands of elements, it may cause performance issues.

In such cases it is advised to use "relations" instead.
====

// TODO Deep copy explanation https://blackbelt.atlassian.net/browse/JNG-5269

=== Identifiers

Identifiers are similar to fields, but can only be primitive types.

When we define identifiers, the architecture is responsible to ensure that every value is unique. This is enforced at creation
and update calls as well by the corresponding DAOs.

**Example:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity User {
    identifier required Email email;
}
----
[source,java]
----

@Autowired
UserDao userDao;

@Test
void testIdentifier() {

    User user1 = userDao.create(UserForCreate.builder().withEmail("same@mail.com").build());
    // Will throw ValidationException because the email is not unique
    User user2 = userDao.create(UserForCreate.builder().withEmail("same@mail.com").build());

}
----
In this scenario, every `User` will have different `email` attributes, enforced by the architecture.

=== Relations

Before continuing, make sure you double-check the corresponding xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#relations[Relations,window=_blank]
section in the JSL DSL docs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The main difference between relations and fields is the lifecycle of them. While fields are "composited" and tied to the
lifecycle of the inclusive Entity, relations are managed via DAOs.
====

One may consider relations as associations between entities.

**For example:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity abstract Customer {
    field required Address address;
    relation Order[] orders opposite: customer;
}

entity Person extends Customer, User {
    field required String firstName;
    field required String lastName;
    field String fullName <= self.firstName + " " + self.lastName;
}
----

Based on the example above, the corresponding SDK code will be the following:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Test
void testRelations() {
    Person johnPerson = personDao.create(PersonForCreate.builder()
                    .withFirstName("John")
                    .withLastName("Doe")
                    .withEmail("john@doe.com")
                    .withAddress(AddressForCreate.builder()
                            .withCity("Budapest")
                            .withStreet("Rose")
                            .build()
                    )
                    .withOrders(List.of(/* list of Orders */))
                    .build()
    );

    personDao.addOrders(johnPerson, List.of(/* ... */));
    personDao.removeOrders(johnPerson, List.of(/* ... */));
    List<Order> ordersQueried = personDao.queryOrders(johnPerson).selectList();
}
----

As we can see, the `orders` relation can only be queried via the `Person` entity's `PersonDao`.

==== Person vs PersonForCreate

When creating, you must use a `PersonForCreate` instance. You can use `PersonForCreate.builder()`. This builder includes all the relations that the Person entity has, including the inherited ones. You can only set the association relation with an existing instance here. Composition fields, such an Address, require an `AddressForCreate` instance.

After the creating you get a `Person` instance that only contains the fields and composition relations.

The reason why the lifecycle is split for fields and relations is based on historical experience managing these two
concepts.

Based on what we learned in the past years, it turned out that it's much easier to reason about the lifecycle
of Entities, and their fields (composite, or primitive) this way. In our case, our SDK is straight forward.

Loose coupling (relations) are managed via DAOs, and tighter couplings (fields) are managed on an Entity level.

==== One Way vs Two Way vs opposite-add

Relations can be defined in various ways.

**One way:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity OrderItem {
    field required Integer amount;
    // ...
}

entity Customer {
    relation required OrderItem favouriteItem;
    // ...
}

entity Person extends Customer, User {
    // ...
}
----

Going with this setup the `CustomerDao` will contain the following methods (besides CRUD methods):

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Autowired
OrderItemDao orderItemDao;

@Autowired
ProductDao productDao;

@Test
void testOneWay() {

    Product butter = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Butter").withPrice(2).build());
    Product chainsaw = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Master Chainsaw").withPrice(1500).build());

    OrderItem orderItem = orderItemDao.create(OrderItemForCreate.builder().withAmount(1).withProduct(chainsaw).build());

    Person johnPerson = personDao.create(PersonForCreate.builder()
            .withFirstName("John")
            // ...
            .build()
    );

    // new PersonDAO APIs:
    Optional<OrderItem> favouriteItem = personDao.queryFavouriteItem(johnPerson); // Optional empty
    personDao.setFavouriteItem(johnPerson, orderItem);
    personDao.unsetFavouriteItem(johnPerson);
    personDao.createFavouriteItem(
            johnPerson,
            OrderItemForCreate.builder().withAmount(150).withProduct(butter).build()
    );
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `.setFavourite()` can only set existing Order elements.

====

**Two way:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity abstract Customer {
    relation Order[] orders opposite: customer;
    // ...
}

entity Person extends Customer, User {
    // ...
}

entity Order {
    relation required Customer customer opposite: orders;
    // ...
}
----

Modeling the two entities this way, the resulting DAO APIs are extended to contain the following methods:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
AddressDao addressDao;

@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Autowired
OrderDao orderDao;

@Autowired
PoductDao productDao;

@Test
void testTwoWay() {
    Product butter = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Butter").withPrice(2).build());
    Person johnPerson = personDao.create(PersonForCreate.builder()
            .withFirstName("John")
            .withLastName("Doe")
            .withEmail("john@doe.com")
            .withAddress(AddressForCreate.builder()
                    .withCity("Budapest")
                    .withStreet("Rose")
                    .build()
            ).build()
    );

    // new PersonDAO APIs:
    personDao.createOrders(johnPerson, List.of(/* ... */));
    personDao.addOrders(johnPerson, List.of(/* ... */));
    personDao.removeOrders(johnPerson, List.of(/* ... */));
    personDao.queryOrders(johnPerson).selectList();
    List<Order> queriedOrders = personDao.queryOrders(johnPerson).selectList();

    Order order = orderDao.create(OrderForCreate.builder()
            .withStatus(OrderStatus.OPEN)
            .withCustomer(johnPerson.adaptTo(Customer.class))
            .build()
    );

    orderDao.createOrderItems(order, List.of(OrderItemForCreate.builder().withAmount(50).withProduct(butter).build()));

    // new OrderDAO APIs:
    Customer customerForOrder = orderDao.queryCustomer(order);
    orderDao.setCustomer(order, customerForOrder);
}
----

**Opposite add:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity OrderItem {
    relation required Product product opposite-add: orderItems[];
    // ...
}

entity Product {
    // ...
}
----

The "opposite-add" case is a bit different compared to the ones above. If you model your relations this way, the `ProductDao`
will be adjusted, even though we did not define any relation pointing to the `OrderItem` entity.

The resulting `OrderDao` API will contain the following additional methods:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ProductDao productDao;

@Test
void testOppositeAdd() {
    Product chainsaw = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Master Chainsaw").withPrice(1500).build());

    // new ProductDAO APIs:
    productDao.createOrderItems(chainsaw, List.of(/* ... */));
    productDao.addOrderItems(chainsaw, List.of(/* ... */));
    productDao.removeOrderItems(chainsaw, List.of(/* ... */));
    List<OrderItem> queriedOrderItems = productDao.queryOrderItems(chainsaw).selectList();
}
----

entity Person {
    relation Person bestFriend;
}
----

The following methods will be generated:

* `Optional<Person> queryBestFriend(Person object)`
* `void setBestFriend(Person object, Person relatedObject)`
* `void unsetBestFriend(Person object)`

==== Required Single Relations

For the given model:

[source,jsl]
----
entity Person {
    relation required Animal pet;
}
----

The following methods will be generated:

* `Animal queryPet(Person object)`
* `void setPet(Person object, Animal relatedObject)`

In case of `required` relations, DAOs will not contain an `unset` method.

==== Multiple Relations

For the given model:

[source,jsl]
----
entity Person {
    relation Order[] orders;
}
----

The following methods will be generated:

* `List<Order> createOrders(Person object, List.of(/* OrderForCreate */))`
* `Order createOrders(Person object, OrderForCreate relatedObject)`
* `void addOrders(Person object, List.of(/* ... */))`
* `void addOrders(Person object, Order relatedObject)`
* `void removeOrders(Person object, List.of(/* ... */))`
* `void removeOrders(Person object, Order relatedObject)`
* `QueryCustomizer queryOrders(Person object)`

The main difference between `createOrders` and `addOrders` is that `createOrders` explicitly creates not yet persisted
entries, while `addOrders` throws an exception if any of them are not yet persisted.

=== Calculated members

Calculated members are dynamic attributes on each entity. The purpose of them is to give developers means to define complex
"data types" where values are calculated at runtime, rather than statically persisting them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Calculated values are computed at query time, only once. If you would like to "refresh" a derived value, you must persist your
instance state (if there are changes), and re-fetch it by e.g.: calling `getById()`, or `.query()` on a DAO.
====

**For example:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity Person extends Customer, User {
    field required String firstName;
    field required String lastName;
    field String fullName <= self.firstName + " " + self.lastName;
}
----

The `fullName` attribute's value is not persisted in the database, but calculated when an instance is fetched.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PersonDao personDao;

@Test
void testCalculatedMembers() {
    personDao.create(PersonForCreate.builder()
            .withFirstName("John")
            .withLastName("Doe")
            .withEmail("john@doe.com")
            .withAddress(AddressForCreate.builder()
                    .withCity("Budapest")
                    .withStreet("Rose")
                    .build()
            ).build()
    );

    List<Person> persons = personDao.query()
            .filterByEmail(StringFilter.equalTo("john@doe.com"))
            .selectList();

    persons.get(0).setFirstName("Johny");
    // the calculated member hasn't changed
    assertEquals(Optional.of("John Doe"), persons.get(0).getFullName());

    // refresh person calculated fields
    Person person = personDao.update(persons.get(0));
    assertEquals(Optional.of("Johny Doe"), person.getFullName());
}
----

Calculated members are not limited to primitive types!

You may find a detailed description of the expression syntax for calculated members in the xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#calculated-members[Calculated members,window=_blank]
section of the JSL DSL documentation.

=== Fetching

You can influence the behavior of a relation. You have the flexibility to fetch a relation like a field.
For more information, you can refer to the xref:meta-jsl:05_entity.adoc#fetching-strategy[Fetching strategy,window=_blank] section.

**For example:**
[source,jsl]
----
entity OrderItem {
	relation required Product product opposite-add: orderItems[] eager: true;
	field required Integer amount;
	field String productName <= self.product.name;
	field Integer price <= self.amount * self.product.price;
}

entity Product {
	identifier required String name;
	field required Integer price;
}
----
[source, java]
----

@Autowired
ProductDao productDao;

@Autowired
OrderItemDao orderItemDao;

@Test
public void testFetch() {

    Product product = productDao.create(ProductForCreate.builder().withName("Butter").withPrice(3).build());

    OrderItem orderItem = orderItemDao.create(OrderItemForCreate.builder().withAmount(20).withProduct(ProductForCreate.builderFrom(product).build()).build());

    assertEquals("Butter", orderItem.getProduct().getName());
}
----


=== Instance Query

Queries are dynamic capabilities of Entities. They let the modeler create dynamic functions/methods which can return values
for entity instances at runtime.

Main differences distinguishing `calculated` members from `queries` from an SDK point of view:

[options="header"]
|======================================================================
|Property                               | derived   | query
| Available on Entity                   | `true`    | `false`
| Available on Dao                      | `false`   | `true`
| Runs when Entity is queried           | `true`    | `false`
| Can be run multiple times, manually   | `false`*  | `true`
| Can have input parameters             | `false`   | `true`
|======================================================================

__* Calculated values can be "refreshed" by re-query-ing the entity instance__

As stated in the table above, instance queries are defined as entity members, however, from a technical point of view
the `query` is generated on DAOs, and not as methods/fields on entities.

Since queries are methods on DAOs, they can be called explicitly any number of times.

Regardless of the number of parameters in the model, the DAO method's first parameter will always be an instance
of the entity on which we defined the query.

**Example:**

[source,jsl]
----
entity Lead {
    field Integer value default: 100000;
    relation required SalesPerson salesPerson opposite: leads;
    // ...
}

entity SalesPerson extends Person {
    relation Lead[] leads opposite: salesPerson;
    relation Lead[] leadsOver10 <= self.leadsOver(limit = 10);
    // ...
}

query Lead[] leadsOver(Integer limit = 100) on SalesPerson <= self.leads.filter(lead | lead.value > limit);

----

One of the many neat aspects of queries is the ability for them to be composed into other entity members.

In the example above, we should notice the use of the `calculated` field `leadsOver10` utilizing the `leadsOver` query.

The corresponding Java SDK should look like the following:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
SalesPersonDao salesPersonDao;

@Test
void testQuery() {
    SalesPerson createdSalesPerson = salesPersonDao.create(SalesPersonForCreate.builder()
            .withFirstName("Super")
            .withLastName("Person")
            .withEmail("super.person@mail.com")
            .withAddress(AddressForCreate.builder().withStreet("Rose").withCity("Budapest").build())
            .build()
    );

    List<Lead> leadsOver = salesPersonDao
            .queryLeadsOver(createdSalesPerson, SalesPersonLeadsOverParameter.builder()
                    .withLimit(200) // explicit definition of "limit" to have value of 200 instead of the default 100
                    .build()
            )
            .selectList();

    List<Lead> leadsOver10 = salesPersonDao.queryLeadsOver10(createdSalesPerson).selectList();
}
----

Queries return type depend on the following query types in JSL:

  *  Primitive queries will return the primitive type representation.
  *  Single-entity queries will return an Optional within the Entity class.
  *  List-entity queries will return a QueryCustomizer.

== Static Query

Since static queries are defined on a root level of our models, they are considered special. They cannot be directly tied
to entities, therefore they cannot be generated on entity prefixes/namespaces (e.g.: `LeadDao`). Every static query
defined in our model will manifest a dedicated DAO (e.g.: `TotalNumberOfLeadsDao`).

**Example:**

[source,jsl]
----
model QueryModel;

type numeric Integer precision : 9 scale : 0;

query Integer totalNumberOfLeads() <= Lead!all()!size();
query Lead[] rootAllLeadsBetween(Integer min = 0, Integer max = 100) <= Lead!filter(l | l.value > min and  l.value < max);
query Integer rootCountAllLeadsBetween(Integer min = 0, Integer max = 100) <= Lead!filter(l | l.value > min and  l.value < max)!size();

entity Lead {
	field Integer value;
}
----

Depending on the return types, and the existence or absence of parameters, the generated APIs differ.

=== Parameterless Static Query

Parameterless static queries are generated in their corresponding dedicated DAOs. If the return type is not a list, they contain an `.selectOne()` or `selectValue()` method otherwise, they contain a `.query()` method.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
TotalNumberOfLeadsDao totalNumberOfLeadsDao;

@Autowired
LeadDao leadDao;

@Test
public void testStaticQuery() {
    leadDao.create(LeadForCreate.builder().withValue(50).build());
    leadDao.create(LeadForCreate.builder().withValue(175).build());

    assertTrue(2 == totalNumberOfLeadsDao.selectValue());
}
----

=== Static Queries with parameters

Compared to parameterless static queries, the generated Java methods differ based on return types.

Methods for queries returning:

* Collections start with "query", and parameters can be set on them. Since queries are builders, we need to call the `.selectList()` or `.selectOne()` method to retrieve the actual results.
* Single references, or primitives: contain an `.selectOne()` or `.selectValue()`, and parameters can be set on the same method.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
RootAllLeadsBetweenDao rootAllLeadsBetweenDao;

@Autowired
RootCountAllLeadsBetweenDao rootCountAllLeadsBetweenDao;

@Autowired
LeadDao leadDao;

@Test
public void testStaticQuery() {
    leadDao.create(LeadForCreate.builder().withValue(50).build());
    leadDao.create(LeadForCreate.builder().withValue(175).build());

    List<Lead> rootAllLeadsBetween = rootAllLeadsBetweenDao.query(
                    RootAllLeadsBetweenParameter.builder()
                            .withMax(80)
                            .withMin(10)
                            .build())
            .selectList();

    assertEquals(1, rootAllLeadsBetween.size());
    assertEquals(Optional.of(50), rootAllLeadsBetween.get(0).getValue());

    Integer rootCountAllLeadsBetween = rootCountAllLeadsBetweenDao.selectValue(RootCountAllLeadsBetweenParameter.builder()
            .withMin(10)
            .withMax(80)
            .build()
    );

    assertTrue(1 == rootCountAllLeadsBetween);
}
----

The reason why the API is different for collection types and every other type is to let developers provide additional
filter and paging capabilities as traditional queries have.

**Example:**

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
RootAllLeadsBetweenDao rootAllLeadsBetweenDao;

@Test
public void testStaticQuery() {
    // ...

    List<Lead> rootAllLeadsBetween = rootAllLeadsBetweenDao.query(RootAllLeadsBetweenParameter.builder()
                    .withMax(80)
                    .build())
            .orderBy(LeadAttribute.VALUE) // additional ordering
            .selectList(20); // additionl limit
}
