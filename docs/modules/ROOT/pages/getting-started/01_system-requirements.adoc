== JDK 11

JUDO is built and tested currently against OpenJDK 11. Our recommended vendor is https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&package=jdk[Zulu JDK]

> Although the recommended version is JDK 11, the generated code and applications might work with newer versions as well

Checking your JDK version:

[source,bash]
----
java -version
----

Which should display something similar to:

[source,bash]
----
openjdk version "11.0.16" 2022-07-19 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.58+15-CA (build 11.0.16+8-LTS)
...
----

> The key here is the version number, which in our case is: `11.0.16`. The version number should start with `11`!

== Maven 3.8.x

Our project orchestrator and build tool is https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven v3.8.x].

Checking your Maven version:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -version
----

Which should display something similar to:

[source,bash]
----
Apache Maven 3.8.6
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
...
----

> The key here is again, the version number, which in our case is: `3.8.6`. The version number **MUST** start with `3.8`!
