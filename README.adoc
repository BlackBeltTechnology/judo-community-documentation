# JUDO Community Documentation

*The build process does not work when ran inside git-submodules:*
https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/895

_(Please check out the project separately)_

## Build UI

Every time we make changes in the UI sources, we need to build the package, and `git add ui/build/ -f` the new artifact!

```bash
cd ui
# install only if you haven't done it recently / package.json didn't change
npm install
npm run build
```

### Customize JSL Highlighting

* ui/src/css/highlight.css
* ui/src/js/vendor/highlight.bundle.js

> UI rebuild is mandatory after making changes!

## Build Documentation

> Certain Antora Modules are pulled in from different Git Repos

### Default way (implicit cloning git repo dependencies)

```bash
mvn clean install -Dclone
```

### If there are no changes in remotes

```bash
mvn clean install
```
