# JUDO Community Documentation

*The build process does not work when ran inside git-submodules:*
https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/895

_(Please check out the project separately)_

## Build Documentation

> Certain Antora Modules are pulled in from different Maven artifacts

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Build UI

The `ui` folder contains the theming of the documentation and it's source code.

By default the `mvn clean install` command runs the build process for it, but it is not mandatory if we are only working
on the docs, and not the theme.

**IMPORTANT!**

The entry `build/index.html` file is copied by the `maven-resources-plugin` from `src/main/resources`.

This file is necessary because for multi version documentations, Antora explicitly generates "Components", which are
sub-folders under `build`.

Antora does not generate any entry file "above" component folders, therefore we need to take care about it.

**Ignoring ui builds:**

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipBuildUI
```

### Customize JSL Highlighting
